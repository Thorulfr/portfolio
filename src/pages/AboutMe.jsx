                    I'm a full-stack web developer with a penchant for creating
                    especially pleasing user experiences. I've recently
                    completed the University of Utah's full-stack coding
                    bootcamp, but my passion for coding and design hearkens back
                    to time spent building Geocities pages and making Flash
                    animations as an early teen.

                    My education includes an undergraduate degree in German
                    Literature and Linguistics and a Master of Arts degree from
                    the University of Iceland in comparative historical
                    linguistics and network analysis as applied to Swedish and
                    Danish runic inscriptions. I've been a linguistics-nut since
                    about the age of 13, when I first started studying German. I
                    also am an avid fan of guitar, synthesizer, and all things
                    80s.

                    Also, my degree officially bestows upon me the title 'Nordic
                    Master of Viking and Medieval Norse Studies'. Ask me about
                    it!
