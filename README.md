# Benjamin Holt – Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I am a full-stack web developer residing in Salt Lake City. This portfolio showcases myself, my developer abilities, and projects both professional and personal.

## Note

This portfolio is a React single-page-application and is currently hosted directly on GitHub Pages. As such, directly linking to individual pages (other than the homepage) is nonfunctional – if you run into a 404 error, simply reload [the homepage](https://thorulfr.github.io/portfolio/).

I am currently in the process of re-hosting everything on AWS servers, which will solve this problem!
